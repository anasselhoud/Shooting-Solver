# Stability of Mixture layer

In this problem, we will program using Matlab and Python the Shooting method used to solving a boudary value problem (different from Cauchy problem). Our method is applied for a turbulence problem related to Fluid dynamics. 

# # Shooting method: An overview
In thid part, I will explain the shooting method in a more detailed way. The shooting method consists of rewriting this boundary problem as a differential equation.
